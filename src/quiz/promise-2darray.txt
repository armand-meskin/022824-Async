Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

We call sum2DArray which creates a promise (done on the main thread)
the promise runs on the event loop and setTimeout is then used make a new callback 
for the summing of the array.
In the meantime the second call of sum2DArray has been called by the main thread and has been rejected since
a non array object was passed and there are no new callbacks within the promise.
Lastly the first call will resolve.
